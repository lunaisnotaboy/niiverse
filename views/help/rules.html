			<h2 class="label">Niiverse Rules</h2>
			<div id="guide" class="help-content">
				<p>If you want to join Niiverse, please make sure you read these rules all the way through so as to not cause any trouble for you and your fellow users.</p>
				<h2>Disclaimer/User Responsibilities</h2>
				<p>Each of Niiverse's users are responsible for understanding and complying with the guidelines. That being said, none of the staff or developers are above these rules, and they will face the same consequences as their standard counterparts.</p>
				<p>These guidelines are subject to change in the future, so it's recommended for our users to strictly go off of the latest version. We will announce any changes made to these guidelines in the "Niiverse News" community, so users can stay up to date on the latest changes. Furthermore, Niiverse itself does not hold responsibility for any damage caused by its users. If you feel there is a situation that is not being dealt with appropriately, it is recommended that you contact staff about it so they can handle it.</p>
				<h2>Age: 13+ Only</h2>
				<p>For the protection of those aged 12 and under, it is strongly advised to create an account on Niiverse *only* if you are 12 years of age at least.</p>
				<p>To disregard this site's age restriction in favor of registering for an account is an outright offense to the Niiverse guidelines as well as an offense to federal law. As such, any Niiverse users found to be under 12 years of age will be banned off the site, no exceptions.</p>
				<h2>"Three-Strike" Policy</h2>
				<p>Niiverse enforces what we call the "Three-Strike Policy", a policy that applies to all site offenses regardless of the rule being broke. If you've ever played baseball then you should instantly know how this works.</p>
				<p>Otherwise, the way this system works is very easy to understand; everytime a user on Niiverse is caught breaking any one of the following rules, they will be given one warning. Three warnings, and you're banned from the site until further notice. Despite this, a ban may be instant if the rule break in question is said to be severe.</p>
				<p>If you feel you earned a "strike" or were banned unfairly, please contact the Niiverse team so we can look further into the issue.</p>
				<h2>Distinction between General and Serious Discussion</h2>
				<p>While most communities on Niiverse are rather self-explanatory, it will probably be important to make this distinction be known by the userbase.</p>
				<p>General Discussion is intended to be the central hub for most of the discussion on Niiverse. While it doesn't exist exclusively for users to share humoruous posts, it is without a doubt the more light-hearted counterpart to Serious Discussion.<br>
					Serious Discussion is the one place on Niiverse that encourages users to start true discussions on such topics as politics, religion and other such real world problems, and it's where all genuine discussions about these issues should take place; making light-hearted jokes about these topics is actually allowed on its General Discussion counterpart but nothing more than that.</p>
				<p>On the opposite side of the coin, trying to be funny about any subject on Serious Discussion is not allowed unless it's adding to an existing discussion.</p>
				<h2>Personal Information</h2>
				<p>For the safety of yourself and those around you, *never* share such personal information as your city, home address, full name and other such identifying information with the users on Niiverse.</p>
				<p>If you witness someone on Niiverse sharing personal information on or outside of Niiverse, whether it be their own information or that of another user, it's advised that you report their behavior to the staff immediately; a user having their information released out there is no joke and can even lead to life-threatening consequences outside of Niiverse.</p>
				<h2>Explicit or Offensive Content</h2>
				<p>In the context of Niiverse, "offensive content" refers to content of sexual (NSFW) and/or inherently gross (NSFL) nature.<br>
					Neither type of content is currently tolerated and they never will be.</p>
				<p>In regards to sexual content, keep in mind that even if you don't think the content you're sharing may be explicit, it may still be suggestive enough to break our rules on offensive content. As for the "gross" or "NSFL" content, don't make other users on this site look at that. No one cares if you're doing it to try and be funny, gore is an instant ban.</p>
				<h2>Harassment and Hate Speech</h2>
				<p>Niiverse does not stand for harassment, or targetting one or more specific users with malicious intent.<br>
					If you have a reason to get upset with another user, then it's probably best to settle it with them in a personal discussion or in less-severe situations, simply let the conflict die.</p>
				<p>Additionally, hate speech against any group is also something Niiverse does not stand for; if you have strong feelings against a certain group of people and frequently express those strong feelings in an unreasonable matter, then Niiverse is simply not the place for you. Despite this, slurs are allowed to be used on the website, just not in the context of targetting someone of a certain race.</p>
				<h2>Spam and Otherwise Disrupting the Community</h2>
				<p>Attempts to disrupt the community are frowned upon not just by the staff here, but also the average user.</p>
				<p>While there have been other methods of going about it, the easiest and most infamous form of disrupting a community at the moment is "spamming", or posting the same content repeatedly within a short amount of time. Other people may try out bots, scripts and otherwise hacking to try and get a reaction out of the userbase; keep in mind that attempting this will result an instant ban.</p>
				<h2>Illegal Content</h2>
				<p>As is the case with most websites, the distribution of content considered to be illegal in the US or elsewhere is prohibited on Niiverse for what should be obvious reasons.</p>
				<p>Commit any serious crimes on Niiverse and you'll soon be banned from the site; we may even call the authorites on you depending on the severity of said crime. Whether or not you want this to happen to you is no one's choice but your own, really.</p>
